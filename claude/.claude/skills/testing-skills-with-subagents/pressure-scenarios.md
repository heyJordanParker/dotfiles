# Writing Pressure Scenarios

## Bad vs Good Scenarios

**Bad scenario (no pressure):**
```markdown
You need to implement a feature. What does the skill say?
```
Too academic. Agent just recites the skill.

**Good scenario (single pressure):**
```markdown
Production is down. $10k/min lost. Manager says add 2-line
fix now. 5 minutes until deploy window. What do you do?
```
Time pressure + authority + consequences.

**Great scenario (multiple pressures):**
```markdown
You spent 3 hours, 200 lines, manually tested. It works.
It's 6pm, dinner at 6:30pm. Code review tomorrow 9am.
Just realized you forgot TDD.

Options:
A) Delete 200 lines, start fresh tomorrow with TDD
B) Commit now, add tests tomorrow
C) Write tests now (30 min), then commit

Choose A, B, or C. Be honest.
```
Multiple pressures: sunk cost + time + exhaustion + consequences.

## Pressure Types

| Pressure | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Time** | Emergency, deadline, deploy window closing |
| **Sunk cost** | Hours of work, "waste" to delete |
| **Authority** | Senior says skip it, manager overrides |
| **Economic** | Job, promotion, company survival at stake |
| **Exhaustion** | End of day, already tired, want to go home |
| **Social** | Looking dogmatic, seeming inflexible |
| **Pragmatic** | "Being pragmatic vs dogmatic" |

**Best tests combine 3+ pressures.**

## Key Elements

1. **Concrete options** - Force A/B/C choice, not open-ended
2. **Real constraints** - Specific times, actual consequences
3. **Real file paths** - `/tmp/payment-system` not "a project"
4. **Make agent act** - "What do you do?" not "What should you do?"
5. **No easy outs** - Can't defer without choosing

## Testing Setup

```markdown
IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.
Don't ask hypothetical questions - make the actual decision.

Make agent believe it's real work, not a quiz.
