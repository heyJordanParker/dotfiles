description: Interactive design refinement using Socratic method
---

Refine rough ideas into fully-formed designs through questioning and exploration.

## When to Use

- Before writing code or implementation plans
- When idea is unclear or has multiple valid approaches
- Not for mechanical/clear tasks

## Instructions

Use the `brainstorming` skill exactly as written.

The skill will:
1. Ask clarifying questions (not yes/no)
2. Explore alternatives
3. Challenge assumptions
4. Build incrementally toward a clear design

## Output

A refined design ready for implementation planning.
